                <p style="line-height:1.3;"><strong>St. Paul, MN, September 13, 2018</strong> – 
				Carnegie Learning's EMC School (EMC) division, a leading
				provider of digital and blended literacy solutions, today announced its acquisition of Mondo
				Publishing, a company celebrated for its K-5 literacy resources and professional learning services.
				With the addition of Mondo, EMC is realizing its goal of providing a comprehensive K-12 English
				language arts collection.CL).
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">"Mondo's values align perfectly with Carnegie Learning's, as both companies share an
				unwavering faith in teaching and the potential of all students," said Mick Demakos, division
				president at EMC. "In addition to continuing to offer the ELA collections Mondo’s customers have
				come to love, we’ll be expanding its digital offerings through EMC School's Mirrors &amp; Windows
				environment, eventually delivering a comprehensive K-12 ELA experience through our immersive
				Passport<sup style="font-size:12px;">&reg;</sup> platform. More immediately, we can serve teachers and students in the elementary
				grades with a fully integrated and articulated literacy program, with both English and Spanish
				collections."
				</p>

				<p style="line-height:1.3;">Founded in 1986 by educator-turned-entrepreneur and CEO Mark Vineis, Mondo was born from a
				simple idea: that all children can achieve high standards given sufficient opportunity, and that wellsupported
				teachers hold the key.
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">"We looked for a partner with a leading learning technology platform to pivot Mondo’s quality
				literacy resources to a significant digital footprint," said Vineis. "With EMC School and Carnegie
				Learning, we found an innovative digital learning platform and a team that shared our passion for
				questioning assumptions around how an education company can foster educator success."
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">Mondo's leveled reading collections and rich content enhance learning for any K-5 reading
				curriculum and its high-quality books resonate with young students. While other publishers have
				looked for ways to offer fewer choices, Mondo continues to provide rich, culturally diverse books
				in varied trim sizes and shapes that respect student individuality. In addition, Mondo offers
				customized, ongoing professional learning that goes far beyond ensuring optimal implementation
				of its resources, but supports teachers and administrators to deepen their understanding of best
				instructional practices in literacy.
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">EMC is excited to feature the newly released, popular Who's Doing the Work? Guided Reading
				Book Collections selected and written by Jan Burkins &amp; Kim Yaris. Each collection serves a range
				of reading levels and matches the engaging topics and instructional goals for each of the three
				lessons for every grade. Books follow criteria that include complexity, accessibility, engagement,
				representation of people and relevance. Mondo's products will continue to be available through
				Mondo's website.
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">"We are at a critical pivot point in elementary literacy education, where technology can be more
				than just digital assessment and student practice," said Vineis. "As part of Carnegie Learning,
				Mondo's high-quality teacher and student print resources will be available in a dynamic digital
				platform. Building on Carnegie Learning's AI-powered tutoring technology, our intent is to reimagine
				the role of adaptive learning technology in elementary literacy instruction and
				intervention."
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">The acquisition of Mondo represents EMC School's second acquisition this year. In February,
				EMC acquired Zulama, an award-winning education technology company producing innovative
				digital programs for computer literacy in middle and high school.
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">With ongoing investment from CIP Capital, Carnegie Learning will continue to challenge the status
				quo in K-16 learning, aggressively pursuing targeted investments in products, services,
				technology, acquisitions, and research to better empower teachers and students.
