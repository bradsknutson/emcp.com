					<h1>Meet the Zulama Game Design Program</h1>
					<h2>When kids are building games, they’re building enthusiasm<br /> and skills that lead to high-tech careers.</h2>

                    <p style="line-height:1.4;">Does your district struggle to get students (and teachers) excited about STEM subjects and Computer Science? You are not alone!<br /><br />
					
					Today's students need to learn computer skills for tomorrow's jobs. Yet teaching technology is the very thing that most schools are struggling 
					to provide, because: #1: schools can’t find technology curriculum and  #2: most teachers aren’t certified to teach computer science.
					Zulama has solved both problems!<br /><br />
					
					<span style="color:#f00;font-weight:bold;">#1:</span> Zulama has developed an unprecedented way to engage teenagers in programming and STEM subjects—through game design. Our expert instructional 
					designers worked with faculty from one of the top game design programs in the world at Carnegie Mellon University. We developed a mix of modules 
					and courses that fit within middle school and high school curriculum.<br /><br />
					
					<span style="color:#f00;font-weight:bold;">#2:</span> With Zulama, schools don’t need to find and hire computer science teachers. We have developed a way to make programming easy for ALL teachers 
					to teach, regardless of their content area.<br /><br />
