					<h1>Meet the Zulama Game Design Program</h1>
					<h2>When kids are building games, they're building enthusiasm<br /> and skills that lead to high-tech careers.</h2>
				</div>
                <div>
                    <p style="line-height:1.4;">Does your district struggle to get students (and teachers) excited about STEM subjects and Computer Science? You are not alone!<br /><br />
					
					Today's students need to learn computer skills for tomorrow's jobs. Yet teaching technology is the very thing that most schools are struggling to provide, 
					because: #1: schools can't find technology curriculum and #2: most teachers aren't certified to teach computer science. Zulama has solved both problems!<br /><br />
					
					<span style="color:#f00;font-weight:bold;">#1:</span> Zulama has developed an unprecedented way to engage teenagers in programming and STEM subjects—through 
					game design. Our expert instructional designers worked with faculty from one of the top game design programs in the world at Carnegie Mellon University. We 
					developed a mix of modules and courses that fit within middle school and high school curriculum.<br /><br />
					
					<span style="color:#f00;font-weight:bold;">#2:</span> With Zulama, schools don’t need to find and hire computer science teachers. We have developed a way to 
					make programming easy for ALL teachers to teach, regardless of their content area.<br /><br />
					
					Through hands-on, project-based learning, Zulama students develop portfolios and skills they need to be successful in today's global workforce. Students are 
					prepared to pursue careers not only in the game industry, but a wide variety of fields that combine creativity and Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
					Mathematics (STEM).<br /><br />
					
					Teachers, students, and professional game designers all agree: game design is an awesome way to learn how to code! Zulama by EMC School offers an engaging, 
					rigorous, and standards-based computer science and game design curriculum perfect for middle and high schoolers.<br /><br />
