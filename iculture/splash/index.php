            <h2>Welcome to the new and improved i-Culture!</h2>
            
            <p>We have been hard at work to enhance your i-Culture experience and are proud to announce a brand new interface.  All of the same great content you have come to know and love is still here.  The current issues of i-Passport, i-Videos, i-News, and i-Songs can now be found right alongside our rich archives, organized by school year and month.</p>
            
            <p>Along with the new design, all of the content in i-Culture is now mobile-friendly.  This includes support for all modern browsers and operating systems, including iOS and Android.</p>
            
            <p>We hope you enjoy the new experience!</p>
