				<p><strong>U.S. Export Controls</strong></p>
				
				<p>Software from or related to this Website (the "Software") may be subject to United States export controls. No Software may be downloaded from this Website or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of 
				U.S. export laws. Downloading or using the Software is at your sole risk.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Governing Law</strong></p>
				
				<p>Use of this Website and these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota of the United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. In the event that 
				any portion of these Terms and Conditions is deemed unenforceable, unlawful or void by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction, in any jurisdiction for any reason, including but not limited to the scope, duration 
				or area of its applicability, unless narrowed by construction, such provision shall for purposes of such jurisdiction only, be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable provision had been more 
				narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable (or if such language cannot be drawn narrowly enough, the tribunal making any such determination shall have the power to modify, to the extent 
				necessary to make such provision or provisions enforceable in such jurisdiction, such scope, duration or area or all of them, and such provision shall then be applicable in such modified form in such jurisdiction). 
				If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such provision would be held to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction only, shall be 
				ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, prohibition or unenforceability, without invalidating the remaining provisions. No narrowed construction, modification or invalidation of any provision shall affect 
				the construction, validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. No waiver by EMC of any term or condition of these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver 
				of such term or condition or of any other term or condition, and EMC'S failure to assert any right or demand compliance with any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver 
				of any such right or provision.</p>
				
				<p>Unless EMC shall otherwise elect, any dispute concerning these Terms and Conditions or your access or use of this Website or otherwise relating to the subject matter hereof shall be submitted to binding 
				arbitration in Minnesota [within one (1) year from the date that the cause of action arose (or, if multiple causes of action are involved, from the date that the first cause of action arose)], with such 
				arbitration conducted pursuant to the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no arbitration relating to these Terms and Conditions shall be 
				joined to any other action or arbitration.</p>
				
				<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in these Terms and Conditions, EMC may at any time (whether within the above one (1) year period or thereafter) seek injunctive or other appropriate 
				relief against you and/or against others, in any state or federal court in the state of Minnesota or of any other jurisdiction that EMC deems appropriate, in the event that EMC believes that there is a 
				violation, or a threatened violation, of any intellectual property rights and, in such case, you hereby consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such court.</p>
