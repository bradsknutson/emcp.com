					Carnegie Learning and New Mountain Learning Merge to
					Create a Comprehensive, Dynamic, and Progressive Learning Technology Company
				</h2>
				
				<p style="font-size:26px;line-height:1.5;">Combining unparalleled digital learning technology with world-class content and professional learning services, the new company seeks to re-define the
					role of technology across the K-16 landscape.
				</p>
				
                <p style="line-height:1.3;"><strong>New York, September 6, 2018</strong> – CIP Capital today officially announced that it has completed an
				investment in Carnegie Learning, a leading provider of innovative, research-proven math products and
				services, and will be merging it with recently acquired New Mountain Learning (NML), a leading provider
				of literacy, language and digital competency skills to create a <strong>comprehensive, dynamic</strong>, and
				<strong>progressive</strong> learning technology company. The new company will be called Carnegie Learning, Inc.(CL).
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">The decision to ally New Mountain's brands — EMC School, Paradigm Education Solutions, and JIST Career Solutions — 
				with Carnegie Learning's brands was a natural one. Through its 
				<a href="https://www.longlivemath.com/" target="_blank" class="learn-more-link">LONG + LIVE + MATH<sup style="font-size:10px;">TM</sup> Movement</a>, Carnegie Learning is 
				uniquely positioned to help teachers cultivate strong cultures of collaborative learning, not just around math, but across STEM and literacy. Advocating 
				a belief in teaching and an unwavering optimism in smart technology to serve students as learners and thinkers, LONG + LIVE + MATH will drive CL's expansive, 
				new <strong>LONG + LIVE + LEARNING<sup style="font-size:10px;">TM</sup> Movement</strong>.
				</p>

				<p style="line-height:1.3;">More specifically, by leveraging the distinct competencies of each organization, the new CL will now serve K-12 customers with both core and supplemental 
				solutions, including: math, English language arts, computer science, and world languages content; master practitioner-led professional learning services, 
				and; innovative digital learning platforms. The merger also brings together innovative brands to serve Higher Ed students through a wealth of flexible, 
				affordable resources, to attain digital and technical competency for career success.
				</p>

				<h3 style="font-weight:500 !important;">The Why behind the Merger</h3>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">
					<ul style="line-height:1.3;">
						<li>To accelerate a shared vision to create a comprehensive, nimble, K-16 blended learning leader, delivering math, science, English language arts, 
							world languages, computer science and coding, and career readiness across the K-16 spectrum</li>
						<li>To transform education through a dynamic digital learning experience for K-12, fusing EMC School's engaging and innovative platform (Passport) 
							with Carnegie Learning's AI-based, cognitive tutoring (MATHia)</li>
						<li>To combine two of the market's most progressive and experienced management teams to challenge the status quo around how a learning company 
							delivers educator success, packaging the right balance of content, intuitive instructional and software design, intelligent technology, and 
							"all in" services</li>
					</ul>

				<h3 style="font-weight:500 !important;">Comprehensive Blended Learning Portfolio</h3>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">The new CL will offer a comprehensive digital and print product portfolio, spanning math, science, computer science and coding, English language arts, 
				world languages, digital skills and career readiness. This expanded portfolio will deliver high-quality content, professional learning and data analysis 
				services, and smart learning technology to more K-12 districts and Higher Ed institutions. As such, CL will provide even more complete, integrated solutions 
				to districts and institutions across content areas, helping simplify implementations and improve efficiencies.
				</p>

				<p style="line-height:1.3;">"Carnegie Learning started 20+ years ago with a singular mission — to merge cognitive and learning research, adaptive technology, and proven master math practice 
				to improve student outcomes," explained Barry Malkin, newly named CEO and President of CL. "Now, with this merger and CIP Capital's continued support, we have an 
				even more inclusive opportunity — to re-imagine the role of adaptive learning technology, not just in math, but across STEM, literacy, and beyond."

				<h3 style="font-weight:500 !important;">Dynamically Re-Defining Digital Learning</h3>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">Bringing together the technology capabilities of both companies strengthens and accelerates a shared goal to re-define digital learning. EMC School's Passport 
				is a leading learning technology environment, elegantly designed to serve as a hub for interactive eBooks, collaborative activities, multimedia content, 
				project-based learning, and assessments. Similarly, Carnegie Learning's MATHia is the market's first and most powerful AI-powered tutoring technology that 
				delivers skill-based, topic-focused math instruction. When integrated, CL envisions a future where Passport will become the central location for student learning, 
				with students interacting with AI-driven tutors across multiple subject areas.
				</p>

				<p style="line-height:1.3;">Eric Cantor, Executive Chairman of CL, stated: "Over the last five years, EMC School, Paradigm Education Solutions (PPI), and JIST Career Solutions (JIST) 
				have established themselves as leading brands in literacy and career readiness, with one of the market's most innovative digital platforms in Passport. We look 
				forward to leveraging this exceptional platform for growth as we combine Carnegie Learning's research-proven, cognitive tutoring technology with EMC's and PPI's 
				rich content and technology assets to help teachers engage students in deep, conceptual learning — not just assessment and practice — across the K-16 content 
				spectrum. This kind of learning is what's needed and the new CL is in the perfect position to deliver it."
				</p>

				<p style="line-height:1.3;">Daniel Schwartz, a Principal at CIP Capital and member of the Board, added, "Going forward, CL will aggressively explore additional investments to better 
				serve educators through new products, services, acquisitions, and research. We are excited to support the combined CL platform and management team in their 
				ultimate pursuit of driving better student outcomes through continued innovation and best-in-class professional learning."

				tenacious, mission-comes-first talent with years of experience in technology, instructional design, research, operations, marketing and sales, which will 
				propel CL's evolution as a single company. As a result, the wider CL team will be supported and empowered to help educators grow and succeed like never before.
