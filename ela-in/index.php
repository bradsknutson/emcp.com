								Arthur Ashe was born in 1943 in Richmond, Virginia, and eventually became one of the top junior tennis players in the nation.
								After college, he won the U.S. Open, and in 1975 he won both the Wimbledon and World Championship Tennis men's singles titles. He died in 1993 of AIDS,
								contracted from a blood transfusion after open-heart surgery. Arthur Ashe Stadium was dedicated in Flushing Meadows, New York, in 1996, and in 2005,

								Toni Cade Bambara (1939–1995) grew up in Harlem, New York, among other places, and described herself as “a writer since childhood.” As a college professor, writer, social activist, and filmmaker, Bambara worked throughout her life to fight oppression and injustice. An avid civil rights activist in the 1960s and 1970s, Bambara saw her writing as a vehicle for truth in a “racist, hardheaded, heedless society” and said, “The job of the writer is to make revolution irresistible.”
<br /><br />
EMC is proud to feature the work of Toni Cade Bambara within Mirrors & Windows. Bambara’s short stories “The War of the Wall” and “Raymond’s Run” are featured in Mirrors & Windows Level 2/Grade 7 and Level 3/Grade 8.

								Elizabeth Bishop (1911–1979) lost her parents at a young age and was shuffled among relatives before being sent to live with her grandparents in Nova Scotia, Canada. After graduating from Vassar College, she lived abroad, traveling around Europe and Africa before settling in Brazil for sixteen years. After the death of her closest Brazilian friend, Bishop returned to the United States to teach at Harvard in the 1970s. Bishop won many awards during her lifetime, including the 1956 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. She also wrote short stories, translated Portuguese literature, and loved to paint.

<br /><br />
EMC is proud to feature the work of Elizabeth Bishop within Mirrors & Windows. Bishop’s lyric poems “The Filling Station” and “One Art” are featured in Unit 2 of Mirrors & Windows Level 2/Grade 7 and Unit 7 of Mirrors & Windows Level 6/Grade 11.

								Ray Bradbury (1920–2012) was born in Waukegan, Illinois, and published his first stories at nineteen. Describing his inspiration for writing, Bradbury said, “My stories run up and bite me in the leg—I respond by writing down everything that goes on during the bite. When I finish, the idea lets go and runs off.” Bradbury has written across all literary genres, but he is best known for his science fiction short stories and novels, which are poetic and fanciful but address serious themes such as the value of individuality and modern society’s overdependence on technology.
<br /><br />
EMC is proud to feature the work of Ray Bradbury within Mirrors & Windows. Bradbury’s short stories “All Summer in a Day,” “The Foghorn,” and “The Drummer Boy of Shiloh” are featured in Mirrors & Windows Level 1/Grade 6, Level 2/Grade 7, and Level 3/Grade 8; Bradbury’s short stories “A Sound of Thunder” and “There Will Come Soft Rains” are featured in Mirrors & Windows Level 4/Grade 9 and Level 5/Grade 10; and selections from the authorized graphic novel adaptation of Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 by Tim Hamilton is featured in Mirrors & Windows Level 6/Grade 11.

								Willa Cather was born in 1873 in Virginia but moved to frontier Nebraska with her family when she was ten to homestead a tract of land. The family borrowed money to send Cather to the University of Nebraska, where she wrote reviews of books, plays, and music for the Nebraska Journal. In 1906, she moved to New York City and joined McClure's magazine. Cather was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for her novel One of Ours in 1923 and the Howells Medal from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1930 for Death Comes for the Archbishop.

								Ernest Hemingway (1899–1961) was born and raised in Oak Park, Illinois. He began his writing career after high school, working as a reporter for the Kansas City Star. During World War I, an eye problem prevented him from joining the U.S. Army, so he served with an ambulance unit. He was wounded in the war and was awarded the Italian Silver Medal for Valor. His stories and novels, written in a distinctively spare and terse prose style, often reflect his lifelong love of hunting, fishing, and outdoor adventure. Hemingway received a Pulitzer Prize in 1953 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, and is considered one of the greatest fiction writers of the twentieth century.
