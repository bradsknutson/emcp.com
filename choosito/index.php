					Carnegie Learning to Deliver Choosito! through its<br />
					EMC School Passport Platform
				</h2>
				
				<p style="font-size:26px;line-height:1.5;">Choosito!'s artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language
				processing help teachers to curate OER and other Web-based libraries and
				build custom lessons, while empowering students to do targeted Web
				searches by reading level.
				</p>
				
                <p style="line-height:1.3;"><strong>St. Paul, MN, October 2, 2018</strong> – 
				Carnegie Learning, a comprehensive, dynamic, and progressive
				learning technology company, today announced that its EMC School division has signed an
				agreement with Choosito!, a curator of open Web content for learning and a National Science
				Foundation (NSF) Business Innovation Award winner. The agreement ensures that EMC School's
				Passport will be the only comprehensive learning technology platform on the market offering this
				next-generation Web search and indexing.
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">Choosito! leverages artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing in a
				unique way to help both teachers and students. Through a combination of 350,000+ pre-curated
				sites in its Choosito! Library and its powerful Choosito! Web search, teachers can collect OER and
				other resources to build lessons and personalize instruction, easily and efficiently.
				</p>

				<p style="line-height:1.3;">In addition, students can work on their own, searching for content that is both appropriate and at
				their reading level. For example, some tools simply filter out inappropriate content, but still present
				students with an overwhelming collection of resources, often well beyond their reading level.
				Choosito!, on the other hand, presents students with both curated content libraries and other Web
				sources specific to their reading level and content interests.
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">"Delivering Choosito! through the Passport platform is a game-changer across the board,"
				declared Troy Weets, VP of Digital Solutions and Product Management at Carnegie Learning's
				EMC School division. "For starters, it improves efficiency by saving teachers and students time
				and minimizing frustrating content searches. It also helps teachers personalize learning and build
				digital literacy skills. And for Carnegie Learning, as a company at the forefront of adaptive, AIpowered
				learning technology, becoming the only comprehensive platform provider of Choosito! is
				a natural fit."
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">Choosito! is unlike any other search engine solution available today. It is the only engine that:
					<ul>
						<li>Uses artificial intelligence to filter by reading level and subject area</li>
						<li>Offers a teacher-approved library of 350,000+ resources (and growing)</li>
						<li>Helps students become better, more efficient researchers by providing built-in resource evaluation and citation-generation tools</li>
						<li>Makes it easy for teachers to make and share their own mini-libraries (Choosito! Collections)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">As a core feature on Passport, Choosito! Library will be a default offering, with Choosito! Web
				available via a dropdown. Additional curated content libraries will also be developed specifically to
				support Passport content, 10 for each grade from grades 6-12. Teachers will then be able to build
				custom lessons through the actionable tool builder functionality and provide ongoing feedback
				directly to students.
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">"This partnership is a fantastic opportunity for Choosito! for a few reasons," said Choosito!
				Founder and CEO Eleni Miltsakaki. "As a core feature on the popular Passport platform, Choosito!
				will now be available to a much wider community of teachers and students. Plus, with an
				expanding network of users, Choosito!'s machine learning algorithms can really take flight,
				learning and evolving to provide even better results with every click."
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">Weets echoed Miltsakaki’s sentiment: "As a content-driven organization, learning about what
				content has real-world value for our customers is invaluable. This helps us to improve and create
				products that deliver what teachers and students need most in the classroom. This insight could
				also help us expand Choosito!'s impact into our other content areas, including math and computer
				science, which is very exciting."
				</p>
				
				<p style="line-height:1.3;">Beta releases will begin this Fall, with a full release slated for Summer, 2019.</p>
