                    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Nathan Lutz, President of NNELL<br />
						<strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, January 8th, 8-9 pm EST<br />
						<strong>Topic:</strong> Moving On Up: Helping Elementary World Language Students Reach Higher Proficiency<br />
						<strong>Description:</strong> Knowing a student's proficiency level is not only how teachers assess their students, 
						but also how teachers plan for instruction. It also allows students to set personal learning goals for themselves. 
						In this workshop, we'll explore what language looks like at each of the proficiency levels. We shall also explore 
						strategies for helping move students from one proficiency level to the next highest one – in all three modes of 
						communication: interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational. By scaffolding tasks and pushing students out of 
						their comfort zones, teachers will see students explore new language on their own and give them more ownership 
						over their own skills and shows them that they can speak and write at a more advanced level than they imagined.

                    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Nathan Lutz, President of NNELL<br />
						<strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, October 16th, 7-8 pm EST<br />
						<strong>Topic:</strong> Strategies for Maintaining a 90%-Plus Target Language Classroom<br />
						<strong>Description:</strong> ACTFL's position statement on the use of target language in the classroom boldly asserts that
						"research indicates that effective language instruction must provide significant levels of meaningful communication and interactive 
						feedback in the target language in order for students to develop language and cultural proficiency." In fact, the recommendation is 
						that both teachers and learners use the target language as much as possible (90% plus) at all levels, including novice-level 
						elementary students. In this webinar, we’ll explore the steps for creating a target language-friendly environment so all 
						participants are not only comfortable with using the target language, but compelled to use it.
