                    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Nathan Lutz, President of NNELL<br />
						<strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, October 16th, 7-8 pm EST<br />
						<strong>Topic:</strong> Strategies for Maintaining a 90%-Plus Target Language Classroom<br />
						<strong>Description:</strong> ACTFL's position statement on the use of target language in the classroom boldly asserts that
						"research indicates that effective language instruction must provide significant levels of meaningful communication and interactive 
						feedback in the target language in order for students to develop language and cultural proficiency." In fact, the recommendation is 
						that both teachers and learners use the target language as much as possible (90% plus) at all levels, including novice-level 
						elementary students. In this webinar, we’ll explore the steps for creating a target language-friendly environment so all 
						participants are not only comfortable with using the target language, but compelled to use it.
