				<span class="large-red">Our story began in 1954</span> in the basement of a home on the east side of St. Paul, Minnesota. A group of recording specialists and university professors joined forces to develop some of the first educational reel-to-reel tape recordings ever to be used in the classroom.

				<p>By June, the company was operating out of a small office and studio facility at 806 East Seventh Street in St. Paul. The first few years were difficult as EMC was pioneering a new educational technology. In general, schools were not yet ready for tape recordings as a teaching tool. However, factories and industries were increasingly making use of audiovisual aids – tapes and filmstrips – for training and promotions in the workplace. For a time, EMC shifted emphasis from the production of classroom materials to the development of audiovisual training and sales presentations for industrial clients, but continued to offer educational recordings to the school market.</p>

						<h3>A dramatic change</h3>
						
						<p style="margin-bottom: 35px;">Major shifts in the industry came with the National Defense Education Act of 1958, which provided schools with federal funds for new electronic teaching equipment and educational audio-lingual materials.</p>
						
						<p>Through EMC's early pioneer efforts in programming for the classroom, several leading textbook publishers commissioned the company to produce tape-recorded materials to accompany their world language texts. Within the next ten years, EMC was producing and manufacturing both tapes and sound filmstrips for a growing number of major educational publishers. In 1966, EMC resumed development of its own proprietary educational products.</p>
