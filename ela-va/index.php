								Arthur Ashe was born in 1943 in Richmond, Virginia, and eventually became one of the top junior tennis players in the nation.
								After college, he won the U.S. Open, and in 1975 he won both the Wimbledon and World Championship Tennis men's singles titles. He died in 1993 of AIDS,
								contracted from a blood transfusion after open-heart surgery. Arthur Ashe Stadium was dedicated in Flushing Meadows, New York, in 1996, and in 2005,
								the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp honoring Ashe.<br /><br >

								Willa Cather was born in 1873 in Virginia, but when she was ten, her family moved to frontier Nebraska to homestead a tract of land.
								The family borrowed money to send Cather to the University of Nebraska, where she wrote reviews of books, plays, and music for the Nebraska Journal.
								In 1906, she moved to New York City and joined McClure's magazine, first as a contributing editor and then as managing editor. Her first novel,
								Alexander's Bridge, was serialized in that publication in 1912. Over the next five years, she wrote two of her most famous novels, O Pioneers!
								(1913) and My Antonia (1918). She was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for her novel One of Ours in 1923 and the Howells Medal from the American
								Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1930 for Death Comes for the Archbishop. Cather's work is known for its strong, unconventional female
								characters and its well-defined sense of time and place.<br /><br />

								EMC is proud to feature the work of Willa Cather within Mirrors &amp; Windows. Cather's short story "A Wagner Matinee" is featured in Unit 5 of
								Mirrors &amp; Windows Level 6/Grade 11.<br />

								Annie Dillard won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction in 1974 for Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, a collection of essays in which Dillard writes a
								detailed account of the four seasons she spent living in the wilderness at Tinker Creek, located in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Roanoke, Virginia.
								Dillard has also published poetry, fiction, memoirs, and creative nonfiction. Dillard said of writing, "What impels the writer is a deep love for and respect
								for language, for literary forms, for books.... You don't do it from willpower; you do it from an abiding passion for the field."<br /><br />

								EMC is proud to feature the work of Annie Dillard within Mirrors &amp; Windows. Dillard's essay "The Present" from Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is featured

								Rita Dove was born in 1952 in Akron, Ohio, to parents who valued education and reading. After graduating from Miami University in Ohio,
								Dove won a Fulbright Scholarship to study in West Germany and later attended graduate school at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, where she
								earned a master's degree in 1977. Although Dove has written short stories, a novel, and a play, she is best known for her lyrical, free-verse poetry.
								Her poetry collections include "The Yellow House on the Corner" (1980), "Grace Notes" (1989), "Mother Love" (1995), and "On the Bus with Rosa Parks"
								(1999). In 1993, Dove became the first African American to be appointed Poet Laureate of the United States. Dove was named the 2004 Poet Laureate
								of Virginia and Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 2006. She has taught creative writing at the University of Virginia, in
								Charlottesville, for the past fourteen years.<br /><br />

								Patrick Henry was a distinguished political leader during the American Revolution. Born in Hanover Country, Virginia in 1736, Henry was educated at
								home by his father. As a young man, he failed as a storekeeper and farmer but eventually found success after training himself to practice
								law. Known for his courtroom eloquence and skill in composing an argument, Henry soon became a member of the Virginia legislature. In this role,
								he argued aggressively for American defiance of Great Britain. Notably, in 1765, he used his fiery oratory skills to persuade the Virginia House
								of Burgesses to pass resolutions against the Stamp Act. In the following decade, he continues to be a tireless and influential spokesperson for the
								independence movement.<br /><br />

								Thomas Jefferson was born in 1743 into a wealthy land-owning family in Virginia. After attending the College of William and Mary, he practiced
								law and was elected to the Virginia House of burgesses. In 1775, he was sent as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress, where
								he drafted the Declaration of Independence with input from Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and others. Jefferson then returned to the Virginia
								legislature, where he wrote a bill that established religious freedom. He was governor of the state from 1779 to 1781. In the 1780s, Jefferson's
								political career shifted to the national level. After serving as the first secretary of state founder President George Washington and as vice
								president under John Adams, Jefferson was elected the third president of the United States. During his time in office, Jefferson more than doubled
								the size of the country through acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase. After his presidency, Jefferson retired to Monticello, his plantation
								in Virginia. He died there on the Fourth of July, fifty years after signing the Declaration of Independence.<br /><br />

								Robert E. Lee was a colonel in the United States Army when his home state, Virginia, seceded with other Southern states from the Union
								in April 1861. At that time, President Lincoln offered him command of the Union forces. Although Lee did not favor secession and had shown his
								disapproval of slavery by freeing his own slaves years earlier, he declined Lincoln's offer and joined the Confederate Army instead. As commander
								of the Army of Northern Virginia from 1862 to the end of the war, Lee made brilliant use of his limited manpower and supplies. Confederate forces
								defeated Union forces consistently in the major battles of the first years of the war. Nevertheless, Union forces were not seriously weakened by
								these losses, while Lee's forces dwindled. Named general-in-chief of all Confederate forces early in 1865, Lee realized that the South could not
								win the war. Within months, he surrendered, bringing the Civil War to a close. After the war, Lee became president of Washington College in
								Lexington, Virginia. He took a strong stand against the bitterness that continued to divide the nation, working peaceably to restore
								the South.<br /><br />

								Naomi Long Madgett was born in 1923 in Norfolk, Virginia, and spent her early years in New Jersey, where she was  the only girl in her
								neighborhood. She often expressed her loneliness by writing poetry, receiving encouragement from her parents but rejection at her integrated
								school. Madgett's family relocated to St. Louis in 1937, and there the young poet flourished in her all-black school, where students were taught
								to take pride in African-American achievements. Madgett published her first book of poetry, Songs to a Phantom Nightingale, days after graduating
								high school. Madgett served as an English professor at Eastern Michigan University from 1968 to 1984 and founded Lotus Press, a leading publisher
								of black literature, in 1972. Madgett has written nine poetry collections and earned numerous awards, including the American Book Award (1993)
								and an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree (1994). She was named Detroit's poet laureate in 2001.<br /><br />

								Although Edgar Allan Poe (1809 – 1849) led a short and troubled life, few writers have had such enduring popularity and influence. Considered
								the co-creator of the modern short story, Poe also invented detective fiction, wrote lyric poetry, and pioneered the psychological horror story.
								Orphaned at age two, Poe was raised by John Allan, a prosperous Virginia merchant, who gave him a classical education. In his twenties, Poe began
								to write poems and stories while working at various editorial jobs. Although briefly famous for his poem "The Raven," he spent most of his adult
								life in poverty. Even so, Poe was committed to writing. Among his best-known poems are "Annabel Lee" and "The Bells." Both embody Poe’s own definition
								of poetry as "the Rhythmical Creation of Beauty."<br /><br />

								EMC is proud to feature the work of Edgar Allan Poe within Mirrors &amp; Windows. Poe’s narrative poem "Annabel Lee" is featured in Unit 6 of M&amp;W

								Sir Walter Raleigh (1552 – 1618) led a varied life as a soldier, explorer, courtier, philosopher, colonist, poet, student of science, and historian.
								His accomplishments included establishing the Roanoke colony in Virginia and importing the potato to Ireland. A favorite of Queen Elizabeth,
								Raleigh was known for his flamboyant dress, his enthusiasm for life, and his quick temper. He did not find favor with Elizabeth’s successor, King
								James I, who ultimately executed him for treason. In prison, Raleigh wrote his long but unfinished History of the World.<br /><br />

								Cynthia Rylant was born in Hopewell, Virginia, in 1954. A few years after her birth, Rylant's family moved to a small town in the
								Appalachian Mountains. Due to her family's isolated and impoverished circumstances, she did not see a children's book until the age of twenty-three
								and was unaware that such books existed. Today, Rylant is widely known for her works aimed at young readers, including picture books and nonfiction.
								Rylant's 1992 novel Missing May won the Newbery Award.<br /><br />

								John Smith was born in 1580 in Willoughby, England. In 1606, he joined a group of about one hundred people and set sail for the New World.
								There on the Chesapeake Bay, he helped to found Jamestown, the first permanent English colony in America. A year later, he was captured
								by Powhatan, chief of one of the area's native peoples. In later writings, he claimed to have been saved from execution by the chief's young daughter,
								known to history by her nickname, Pocahontas. Smith served as governor of the Jamestown Colony from 1608 to 1609 and then returned to
								England.<br /><br />

								Booker T. Washington (1856–1915) was born to a mother who was a slave in Hale's Ford, Virginia. Like most slaves, Booker had only a
								first name; he adopted his stepfather's first name as his last name. While attending makeshift schools, Washington worked as a salt packer,
								coal miner, and houseboy. Filled with the desire to learn to read and write, he earned his way through Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute
								in Virginia by working as a janitor. He graduated with honors and, in 1881, became the first principal of what is now Tuskegee Institute. He
								became a national figure as a result of a short address, Chapter 14 of Up from Slavery, at the Atlanta Exposition of 1895. Washington received
								an honorary degree from Harvard University, dined with President Theodore Roosevelt, and advised politicians and business leaders.<br /><br />
