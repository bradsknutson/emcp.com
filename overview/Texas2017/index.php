				<h3>The best solutions for Texas world language teachers</h3>
				
				EMC's goal is to equip Texas teachers with world language programs that provide full coverage of all the Texas Education Knowledge and Skills so teachers can focus on what they love to do: teach. 

				<h3>Our world language programs give teachers the tools to...</h3>
				
				Expose students to new cultural content focused on the practices, products, and perspectives of target cultures.<br /><br /> 

				Provide abundant communicative activities to hone students' skills in all 3 modes:  interpersonal, presentational, and interpretive.<br /><br /> 

				Reveal connections to other subject areas and make culture and language comparisons.<br /><br /> 

				Create activities that teach students how to contribute to and build community in the classroom, online, and in their home state of Texas.<br /><br />

				<h3>Students will...</h3>
				
				Demonstrate a better understanding of the target cultures' practices and how they are related to the perspectives of those cultures. Additionally, students will gain an understanding of the 
				products produced by the target cultures and how they are connected to the peoples of those cultures.<br /><br />
				
				Engage in oral and written communicative activities that prepare them to understand dialogues, simple stories, high-frequency commands, and instructions related to familiar topics and themes.<br /><br />
				
				Develop the fundamental knowledge and context required to make relevant connections between the target language and other subject areas. Students will understand cultural concepts through comparisons between 
				their own culture and the target culture while also learning about the influences different cultures have on each other.<br /><br />
				
				Enhance their personal and public lives by using the target language to participate in communities inside and outside the classroom. Students will understand how to use the language both within and beyond the 
				school setting through activities such as participating in cultural events and using technology to communicate with others in immersive experiences.
